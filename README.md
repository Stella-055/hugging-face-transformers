# Using Hugging Face Transformers: From Pipelines to Fine-Tuning

This guide covers the basic steps for working with Hugging Face's `transformers` library, starting from using pre-trained models with pipelines to fine-tuning models with `AutoTokenizer` and `Trainer`.

## 1. Installation
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed using pip.

## 2. Using Pipelines
Hugging Face provides high-level APIs to quickly use models for tasks like text generation, classification, and translation.

## 3. Loading Models and Tokenizers
For more control, load models and tokenizers manually from the `transformers` library.

## 4. Tokenization
Tokenizing input text allows models to process it effectively.

## 5. Fine-Tuning a Model
Fine-tuning involves training a model on a custom dataset.

### Step 1: Load a Dataset
Obtain a dataset from the Hugging Face `datasets` library or a custom dataset.

### Step 2: Tokenize the Dataset
Convert the dataset into a tokenized format suitable for model training.

### Step 3: Define a Training Configuration
Set up the training parameters, including batch size, evaluation strategy, and number of epochs.

### Step 4: Train the Model
Execute the training process with the defined configuration and dataset.

## Conclusion
This guide introduced the basic steps for using Hugging Face `transformers`, from using pipelines to fine-tuning models. You can explore more advanced options like hyperparameter tuning and custom datasets for improved performance.
